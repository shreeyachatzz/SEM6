CNS LAB COMMANDS
EXPERIMENT 1
To see all ip that are up information: ifconfig
To see the data of all interfaces: ifconfig -a
To set any interface down: sudo ifconfig eth14 down
To set an interface to up: sudo ifconfig eth14 up
To see the MTU sizes: ip a | grep mtu
To set packet size to 1000 for a specific interface: ifconfig eth14 mtu 1000 up
To see subnet mask: ifconfig | grep -i mask
To find the DNS server ipadd : cat /etc/resolv.conf
To send 8 pings of size 50: ping -n 8 -l 50 127.0.0.53
To get info about the current connections: netstat -rn
To see the number of hops to a specific ip address: tracert 140.250.206.132
To get the mtr report of a specific ip address: mtr 117.203.246.106
To generate the mtr report with 10 hops and 5 pings: mtr -h 10 -c 5 117.203.246.106

EXPERIMENT 2
File location to access and change the ip address resolution and perform arp poisoning:
C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc> notepad hosts
In the hosts file change the file as:
<ip you want to redirect a site to>	<the website you want to poison>

EXPERIMENT 3
Creating a new user: sudo adduser newname
Copy a Set-UID file: cp cat ./newcat 
See permissions of the new file: ls -l newcat
To set an interface to up: sudo ifconfig eth14 up
To see the MTU sizes: ip a | grep mtu
To set packet size to 1

EXPERIMENT CROWDMARK

Generate executable: gcc -fno-stack-protector -ggdb -m32 Labeval.c -o Labeval
To exploit the program: 
nano runbin.sh
while read -r line; do echo -e $line; done | ./Labeval
Run: ./runbin.sh
GDB: sudo gdb -p `pgrep Labeval`
To print address: print &r
